## Branching ##

We have a lot of branches. In order to understand them we suggest you read this first:

### Master ###

This is the "stable" branch. It only contains code that works. In the future versions will be added as tags.

### hotfixes ###

This branch is a branch where quick bugs in previous releases are fixed. They can be pulled into any of the next branches

### feature branches ###

If I'm working on a new feature, I will branch the hotfixes (=master+general bugfixes) into my feature name. This will allow everyone to work on a working hotfixes branch for his or her new feature.


When all features, most likely at the end of the month, are completed, we're in for a new release.

Any questions? Add a support issue.
